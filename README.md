# IceCream

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.5.
I have used PrimeNG as main UI library. It is a very powerful UI package to make things look better, meanwhile by saving effort and time.\
For handling form better and providing some validations, i have used reactive forms. Regarding styling, i am relying on SCSS.

Access from here [IceCream](https://denisshtupa.github.io/ice-cream/ice-cream) the version deployed on gh-pages
